# Berka Feature Passport: Spend Bucket Classification

Model scope: `bucket_spend_t_plus_1` classification in `step3_model_training_berka/train_classification.py`.

## Launch threshold

- Minimum history before production inference: **8 completed weekly points per `user_id`**.
- Rationale: 8-week rolling and regularity features (`*_rolling_*_8w`, `*_frequency_8w`, `weeks_since_*`) become meaningfully stable only after at least one full 8-week window.
- Current pipeline remains trainable with shorter history because missing/early windows are zero-filled; this threshold is a deployment guardrail.

## Feature order (exact model input order)

The model expects features in this exact order:

1. `bucket_spend_t`
2. `bucket_net_t`
3. `weekly_inflow_t`
4. `weekly_outflow_t`
5. `weekly_net_t`
6. `txn_count_t`
7. `category_diversity_t`
8. `weekly_inflow_t_minus_1`
9. `weekly_outflow_t_minus_1`
10. `weekly_net_t_minus_1`
11. `weekly_inflow_t_minus_2`
12. `weekly_outflow_t_minus_2`
13. `outflow_inflow_ratio_t`
14. `week_of_year`
15. `month`
16. `quarter`
17. `week_of_month`
18. `is_month_start_week`
19. `is_month_end_week`
20. `delta_inflow`
21. `delta_outflow`
22. `inflow_outflow_ratio`
23. `inflow_share`
24. `inflow_rolling_mean_8w`
25. `inflow_rolling_std_8w`
26. `outflow_rolling_mean_8w`
27. `outflow_rolling_std_8w`
28. `inflow_frequency_8w`
29. `outflow_frequency_8w`
30. `weeks_since_inflow`
31. `weeks_since_outflow`

## Feature specification

Notation per user-week `t`:
- `inflow_t = weekly_inflow_t`
- `outflow_t = weekly_outflow_t`
- `net_t = inflow_t - outflow_t`
- `eps = 1e-6`
- train-only bucket quantiles: `q25_spend`, `q75_spend`, `q25_net`, `q75_net`

## Global fill and validation rules

- Columns with lag/rolling/regularity/ratio dynamics are normalized with: `replace([inf, -inf], NaN).fillna(0.0)`.
- Final safety check in builder rejects output if any NaN remains in classification lag features.
- All rolling and regularity features are leakage-safe (`shift(1)` before rolling computations).
